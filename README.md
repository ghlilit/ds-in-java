# Data-Structures
Data Structures classes in Java.
- Here are codes for some popular Data Structures such as Singly, Doubly, Circularly Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues writen by me.
- In addition, there is a class called unique queue, which takes only unique elements.
- A class called Palindrome, which has a method to check if the string is Palindrome.
- And a class called unlimited Stack, which takes user defined size and upon being full, removes the last element to add new ones in constant time. 
- Main1 and Main2 have DS related functions such as sorting a stack, or inserting a linked list into another.
- The comments in Main1 and Main2 are self-explanatory.
